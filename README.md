# Uncommon CSS Bug: Invalid Selectors or Unsupported Properties

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-debug CSS issue: an invalid selector or the use of an unsupported property.  The bug results in unexpected rendering behavior, and standard browser developer tools often provide unhelpful error messages. 

## Bug Description
The bug lies within `bug.css`.  A seemingly simple CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior because of a subtle error in the selector or the use of a browser-unsupported property.  Identifying this will require careful inspection and potentially testing across different browsers.

## Solution
The corrected code is located in `bugSolution.css`.  This solution identifies and fixes the invalid selector or unsupported property.
